<h4>JavaScript Style Guide</h4>

A JavaScript style guide is a set of standards that tells how JavaScript code should be written and organized. 
In this section, we will talk about JavaScript guides and how to write a clean code.

The syntax of JavaScript has to be written following a certain style guideline for sake of convince and simplicity.

Why we need style guide

When you work in team of 10 or 20 or more developer on one project and on the same code base, the code will be messy and hard to manage if there is no any guidelines to follow.

You can develop your own guidelines and conventions or you can also adapt well developed guidelines. 
Let us the most common know guidelines.

In this challenge also we used the general JavaScript coding writing conventions and guides. 
Coding conventions are style guidelines for programming which are developed by an individual, a team or a company.

<h4>Coding conventions helps</h4>:

    to write clean code
    to improve code readability
    to improve code re-useability and maintainability

<h4>Coding conventions includes</h4> 

    Naming and declaration rules for variables
    Naming and declaration rules for functions
    Rules for the use of white space, indentation, and comments
    Programming practices and principles

<h4>Conventions use in 30DaysOfJavaScript</h4>

In this challenge we follow the regular JavaScript convention but I added also my preference of writing.

    We used camelCase for variables and functions.
    All variable names start with a letter.
    We chose to use const for constants, arrays, objects and functions. In stead of double quote, we chose to use single quote or backtick. Single quote is becoming trendy.
    We also removed semicolons from our code but it is a matter of personal preference.
    Space around arithmetic operators, assignment operators and after comma
    Arrow function instead of function declaration
    Explicit return instead of implicit return if the function is one liner
    No trailing comma in the last value of an object
    We prefer this +=, -=, *= /=, **= instead of the longer version
    When we use console.log() it is good to print with a tag string to identify from where the console is coming
